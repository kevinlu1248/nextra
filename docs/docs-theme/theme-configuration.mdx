# Theme Configuration

Here's an example of a theme configuration file:

```jsx
export default {
  logo: <span>My Nextra Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra'
  },
  // ...
}
```

The ellipses (`...`) in the code block above indicate that the code is shortened for brevity. The actual configuration file may contain more properties.

## Copyright Information

Here's an example of how to configure the copyright information:

```jsx
export default {
  footer: {
    copyright: 'Copyright Â© 2023 My Company',
    // ...
  }
}
```

Again, the ellipses (`...`) indicate that the code is shortened for brevity.
